My brainstorming process started with coming up with as many iterations on the formal elements (Player, Objectives, Rules, etc.) of a traditional shmup as I could. After jotting down as many as I could for each element I went back through and narrowed it down to a few ideas that most intrigued me. I was most drawn to the idea of making my shmup a co-op experience that required some sort of unique controls. From here I came up with a few player experience goals. 
#### Player Experience Goals
1. Players should feel like they must work together to succeed and should be rewarded for doing so
2. Players should find themselves in silly/humorous situations in which they must use creative/cooperative thinking to succeed
3. Players must vocally communicate in order to succeed

It's important for me that the game is cooperative and that players are provided with positive reinforcement for working together. I also want the game to be highly interactive and enjoyable for both players and people watching. I plan on implemeting these goals in a number of ways. Challenges the players must face include pressing specific combinations of keys to perform actions based on either predefined controls or information being presented on the screen. Players will also have to rely on their partner to perform certain moves. Additionally, there will be multiple levels of bosses that each require a different method of defeating. My next step will be playtesting different player controls and seeing which ones generate the most fun or interesting experiences.
