# Shmup-Remix
A remix on the traditional shmup video game that requires players to work together and utilize unexpected controls to survive. 

Two players must work together using shared controls to move their character, change weapons, and perform various other actions in order to make it through three levels of increasing difficulty. Each level adds a new control that players must use to beat it. Level 1 tests players control over character movement, level 2 tests their speed and precision in switching weapons/ shooting enemies, and level 3 combines all the previous controls with the addition of a boss that must be defeated by charging into it.

#### Player Experience Goals:
1. Players should feel like they must work together to succeed and should be rewarded for doing so
2. Players should find themselves in silly/humorous situations in which they must use creative/cooperative thinking to succeed
3. Players must vocally communicate in order to succeed
